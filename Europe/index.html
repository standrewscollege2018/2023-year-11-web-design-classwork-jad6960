        <!--United Kingdom-->
        <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
        <p><a href="uk.html">Find out more here</a></p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
        <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>

        <!--Italy-->
        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <p><a href="italy.html">Find out more here</a></p>
        <p>We loved Italy! From the ancient ruins to the beautiful scenery and delicious food, we still have many wonderful memories.</p>


        <!--Greece-->
        <h2>Greece</h2>
        <p><a href="greece.html">Find out more here</a></p>
        <p>Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals.</p>
        <p>We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.</p>

    
        <!--France-->
        <h2>France</h2>
        <p><a href="france.html">Find out more here</a></p>
        <p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.</p>
        <p>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.</p>
        <p>We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
